# Study of the basic Single Column Tie

## Preamble

You may think you know the single column tie (SCT). Maybe you do. Maybe you don't. Let me just say that whenever you are trying to learn something, it is essential to understand the distinction between "what you know", "what you don't know", and "what you don't know, you don't know".

If that statement confuses you, here is tight little  explanation of these three categories of knowledge presented at a Pentagon news conference by Donald Rumsfeld (US Secretary of Defense under President George Bush the 1st) .

The Shibari expert Esinem makes the same observation in his tutorial on the SCT. These notes will come to essentially the same conclusions as his video. However the method of teaching the material is different.

In the following lesson we will do three things:

1. Review the Square knot and the Granny knot because understanding these two knots is how we can understand the SCT.

2. View three video demonstrations of how to tie the basic SCT and examine the results. We will analyze the differences between the three ties and understand their performance.

3. We will then view videos by two experts and extract from them a set of rules for tying the SCT.

4. Finally, we'll solidify our understanding by comparing and contrasting a demonstration of the SCT by The Twisted Monk with what we learned above.

## Preliminaries: Square knot (Reef knot) vs Granny knot

 1.  Square knot (Reef knot)-- Visually you wind up with a pretty knot. It is characterized by two collars with one collar around one pair of lines and one collar around the pair of lines.  It looks like this:

 1. Granny knot --  It looks similar to the Reef knot, but there are no collars. It looks like this:

 ![Granny knot](https://mythyng.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/granny-knot_2.jpeg)

 Although the two knots look similar, the Granny knot collapses under tension. The reason for this has to do with where friction is applied by the ropes. In the case of the square knot, friction tends to pull the ropes in a manner that makes the collars tighter, whereas in the case of the granny knot the friction tends to pull the ropes out the knots. An excellent explanation and demonstration of how this works can be found in a video by [Dr. Shoelace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSbeIb4riK0)

Alright! With those preliminaries out of the way, let's get started!

## The single column tie: First pass

### Reference videos

The following two videos produce exactly the same knot.
The second one is upside down relative to the first.

* [Jerry's SCT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0Y_JYJ6p-8)
* [Hanawa's SCT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GTfPKRYvhc)

These two videos produce a knot with a topology SIMILAR to that of a square knot. To see this, follow the instructions in either video and then inspect the resulting knot. You will observe the characteristic "double collar" of the square knot. It is flat, symmetric and pretty. However, it is NOT a Reef knot. To see this, inspect the knot again. You will see that a pair of ropes passes through one of the loops (just like the Reef knot), but TWO pairs of rope pass through the other collar (the extra pair is one of the wraps around the column).

If you play with the knot you will discover that it has a tendency to collapse or invert when tension is applied to the working ends. The knot does not collapse when tension is applied to the bight. Try it out and see for yourself!

Note that in the comments to Jerry's video (the first video) someone complains that the knot always collapses on him. Jerry says it works for him, and suggests a Sommerville Bowline.

It turns out that this is a well known weakness of this version of the SCT.  A slight change in the knot is all that is needed. A Sommerville Bowline, which is a slightly more complicated knot, is not necessary.

The solution is to tie the SCT in a manner that results in a topology 'like' a Granny knot instead of a topology 'like' a Reef knot. I say the topologies are 'like' because they are not actually Square knots or Granny knots. As we saw above the number of ropes that pass through the collars is not the same in the SCT as in the square knot.

Anyway, the 'Granny knot'-like version of the SCT will not collapse or invert when tension is applied to the standing ends. Accordingly the 'Granny knot variant' is a better knot to use for suspension from the working ends. The 'square knot variant' is better if the suspension will be from the bight.

Here is a demonstration of how to tie the Granny-knot-like variant of the SCT.

This is the version of the SCT that I advocate. It is not as fussy as the "square-knot" version. The only reason I might want to tie the square knot version is if I do not intend to apply significant tension on the standing ends or if I want a symmetrical pretty knot. Both versions are equally compact and flat. My sense is that it is probably best to always tie the "granny-knot" version, so that: 1) muscle memory lets you automatically and speedily tie the knot, and 2) you don't accidentally tie the "square-knot" version in a situation where failure of the knot would be dangerous, e.g. suspensions.

Next we will look at the nuances of which direction to wind the wraps and tie the knot depending on which direction you want the working ends to exit the knot.

### Further analysis by Esinem and Osaka Dan

Checkout Esinem's video below. It is thorough analysis of the single column tie and explains how decide how to tie the knot depending on which direction you want the standing ends to exit the knot. Osaka Dan performs a similar analysis, but it is not quite a clearly presented (in my opinion) as Esinem

### Fernando's rules:

The study results in the following 'rules' to use for tying basic single column ties in any situation. To be concrete let's assume we are tying around a horizontal column.

1. Decide which direction the working end will go when the knot is tied. In the finished knot do you want the working ends to exit the knot coming at you from the bottom or the top of the column? It doesn't always matter, but sometimes it does, e.g. for Futomomos (leg ties).

You can cast the bight away from you over the top of the column and have the working end come at you from below, or you can cast the bight away from you under the bottom of the column and have the working end come at you from the bottom of the column.

1. Next decide on the directionality of the working ends. These are: 1) Upwards or downwards combined with 2) leftwards or rightwards. There are 4 combinations for directionality: upwards/leftwards, upwards/downwards, downwards/leftwards and downwards/rightwards.

After you make your decisions, here are the rules to tie a "Granny-knot" version with the working ends exiting the knot the way you want:

1. Start with the working end going off in the direction that you want it to ultimately go, .e.g leftwards-upwards.
1. Wrap the bight around the column on the same side as you want the working end to exit the knot (left or right)
1. Form a loop with the working ends going off in the same direction that you want them to ultimately go, and on the interior side of the wraps.
1. Pull the bight through the loop and cinch!
1. TAH-DAH!

### Twisted Monk's video
Finally, take a look at this tutorial from the Twisted Monk.

[Twisted Monk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhzIQCoLjDc&t=4s)

It goes a little quickly, but it appears that the part of the bight that goes under the wraps is not incorporated into the knot. So he has two ropes passing through each collar. Instead of having one collar with one pair or ropes passing through it and another collar with two pairs of ropes passing through it.

So he is tying a separate Reef knot above the wraps.

The resulting "true" Reef knot is bigger, bulkier and not nearly as elegant as what we saw above. Note that he makes the statement that the Square knot is better than the Granny knot. This does not contradict Esimem and Osaka Dan's assertions that the Granny knot is superior to the Square knot. In fact, everyone is correct.  The Twisted Monk is tying a true Square knot ABOVE the wraps.  A real Square knot is indeed better than a true Granny knot. The knots that Osaka Dan and Esinem are tying are not true Square or Granny knots. They are SIMILAR.
