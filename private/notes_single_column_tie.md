# Study of the basic single column

## Preliminaries: Reef knot vs Granny knot

 1.  Square knot (Reef knot)-- Visually you wind up with a pretty knot. It is characterized by two collars with one collar around a bight and one collar around the two standing ends. Both the bight and the free ends exit parallel to the wraps.

 1. Granny knot -- over/under, no collar and free ends orthogonal to working ends

## The single column tie: First pass

### Reference videos

The following two videos produce exactly the same knot.

The second one is upside down relative to the first.

The two videos produce a knot with a topology SIMILAR to that of a square knot. To see this, take a close look at the knots after they are tied, and you will see the characteristic "double collar" of the square knot. The knot is symmetrical, flat and pretty. Unfortunately, if you play with the knot you will discover that it has a tendency to collapse or invert when tension is applied to the working ends. The knot does not collapse when tension is applied to the bight. Try it out and see for yourself!

Note that in the comments to the first video someone complains that the knot always collapses on him. Jerry says it works for him, and suggests a Summerville Bowline.

It turns out that this problem is well known! There is a different way of tying a single column tie so that it produces a topology 'like' a Granny knot instead of a topology 'like' a square knot. I say the topologies are 'like' because they are not actually Square knots or Granny knots. Anyway, the 'Granny knot'-like topology will not collapse when tension is applied to the standing ends. Accordingly the 'Granny knot variant' is a better knot to use for suspension from the working ends. The 'square knot variant' is better if the suspension will be from the bight.

### Further analysis by Esinem and Osaka Dan

Checkout Esinem's video below. It is thorough analysis of the single column tie and explains how decide how to tie the knot depending on which direction you want the standing ends to exit the knot.

Osaka Dan does something similar, but not quite a clearly presented (in my opinion) as Esinem

### Fernando's rules:

The study results in the following 'rules' to use for tying strong basic single column ties.

1. Decide which direction the working end will go when the knot is tied. With a horizontal column the choices are Upwards/downwards and leftwards/rightwards. There are 4 combinations of upwards/downwards and leftwards/rightwards.
1. Start with the working end going off in the direction that you want it to ultimately go, .e.g leftwards-upwards.
1. Wrap the bight around the column on the same side as you want the working end to exit the knot (left or right)
1. Form a loop with the working ends going off in the same direction that you want them to ultimately go, and on the interior side of the wraps.
1. Pull the bight through the loop and cinch!
1 TAH-DAH!

### Twisted Monk's video
Finally, take a look at this tutorial from the Twisted Monk.

It goes a little quickly, but it appears that the part of the bight that goes under the wraps is not incorporated into the square knot. Instead he ties a totally separate square knot above the wraps. The resulting knot is bigger, bulkier and not nearly as elegant as what we saw above. Note that he makes the statement that the Square knot is better than the Granny knot. This does not contradict Esimem and Osaka Dan's assertions that the Granny knot is superior to the Square knot. In fact, everyone is correct.  Recall that Twisted Monk is tying an INDEPENDENT knot ABOVE the wraps. So he is tying a pure square knot rather than a knot that is similar to a square knot. A pure Square knot is indeed better than a pure Granny knot. The knots that Osaka Dan and Esinem are tying are not pure Square or Granny knots. They are similar, but in fact the wraps are incorporated into the topology of their knots.
