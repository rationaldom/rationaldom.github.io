# Rope

A good way to find lots of resources is to google "non-binding knots shibari" and search images

## Storage and staging

For rope storage the wraps around the rope should be tight and secure
For staging (good-to-go) wraps around the rope should be easy to release

4 ways of making hanks
short ropes 5-10ft
intermediate length rope 10-20ft
long length rope > 20ft

## Rope as a second language

Rope terms such as 'bend' and 'loop' loop have a common-sense meaning in english, but they have very specific meaning when referring to rope. It is common for people speaking about rope to use the "loose" english meaning. Here I will try to be careful about using precise terms when speaking about rope. This will aid in the descriptions of specific knots ofr situations.



## The overhand knot


### Reef knot vs Granny knot

 Square knot (Reef knot)-- Visually you wind up with a pretty knot. It is characterized by two collars with one collar around a bight and one collar around the two standing ends. Both the bight and the free ends exit the
 Granny knot -- over/under, no collar and free ends orthogonal to working ends

## Study of the basic single column
The two videos below produce a knot with a topology similar to that of a square knot (reef knot). To see this take a close look at the knots after they are tied and you will see the characteristic "double collar" of the square knot. The knot is symmetrical, flat and pretty. Unfortunately, if you play with the knot you will discover that it has a tendency to collapse or invert when tension is applied to the working ends. The knot does not collapse when tension is applied to the bight. Try it out and see for yourself!

These two videos produce exactly the same knot. The second one is upside down relative to the first.

Note that in the comments to the first video someone comments that the knot always collapses on him. Jerry says it works for him, and suggests a Summerville Bowline.

It turns out that this is well known! There is a different way of tying a single column tie so that it produced a topology like a Granny knot instead of a topology like a square knot. The Granny knot toplogy will not collapse when tension is applied to the standing ends. Accordingly this is a better knot to use for suspension from the working ends.

### Further analysis by Esinem and Osaka Dan

Checkout Esinem's video below. This is a thorough analysis of the single column tie and explains how to tie it depending on which direction you want the standing ends to exit the knot.

### Fernando's rules:

1. Decide which direction the working end will go when the knot is tied. Up/down, left right. There are 4 combinations of up/down and left/right.
1. Start with the working end going off in the direction that you want it to ultimately go.
1. Wrap the bight around the column on the same side as you want the working end to exit the knot (left or right)
1. Form a loop with the working ends going off in the same direction that you want them to ultimately go and on the interior side of the wraps.
1. Pull the bight through the loop and "cinch with gusto"!

### Twisted Monk's video
Finally, take a look at this tutorial from the Twisted Monk.

It goes a little quickly, but it appears that the part of the bight that goes under the wraps is not incorporated into the square knot. Instead he ties a totally separate square knot above the wraps. The result knot is bigger, bulkier and not nearly as elegant as what we saw above. Note that he makes the statement that the Square knot is better than the Granny knot. This does not contradict Esimem and Osaka Dan's assertions that the Granny knot is superior to the Square knot. Everyone is correct.  Recall that he is tying an independent knot above the wraps. So he is tying a pure square knot rather than a knot that is similar to a square knot. A pure Square knot is indeed better than a pure Granny knot. The knots that Osaka Dan and Esinem are tying are not pure Square or Granny knots. They are similar, but in fact the wraps are incorporated into the topology of their knots.
