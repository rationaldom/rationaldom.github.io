As a preliminary test, the Dom will command that you put clothespins on sensitive body parts to verify your level of pain tolerance.

The Dom may at any point require you to put on a blindfold or a hood.

## Position training

The Dom will run you through a handful of slave positions to verify that you know the positions and that your response to commands is prompt.
The Dom will determine whether correction is necessary.

If the Dom is not satisfied with your performance you will be punished via timed application of clothes pins to sensitive body parts.

## Aftercare
