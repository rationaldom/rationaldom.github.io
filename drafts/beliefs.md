## Where I'm coming from

I came to D/s late in life and truth be told, my experience is still somewhat limited, but thus far it has been satisfying, intuitive and natural. I'm not going to talk here about the usual stuff. Kinks, implements etc. Instead I'm going to talk about the notion of what it means (to me) to be the mentor in a D/s or M/s dynamic.

I'll start by saying that I see my approach to Dominance and submission as a natural extension of my experience as a professor at a world-class research university. Surprised? That is probably because you, like most people, experience professors as teachers. Indeed, most of the time, when I tell someone that I am a professor the first question they ask is "What do you teach?". I invariably have to explain that teaching is actually a small part of my job.

Most professors at elite research universities do little teaching. We don't get hired to teach. We get hired to perform world-class research, to be leaders in our fields, to create and fund research groups, and to mentor the next generation of world-class researchers. Teaching is almost incidental.

What does this have to do with D/s and M/s? First of all, in a research university there is a clear hierarchy of rank based on demonstrated achievement. There is deference to higher ranks. Graduate students and undergraduate students are at the bottom of the hierarchy and are deferential to professors.  The professors are often referred to as mentors and the students as mentees. The use of earned "honorifics" reflects the relationship. But instead of being referred to as "Sir" or "Master" or "Mistress", we are referred to as "Professor" or "Doctor". In Germany the literal translation of the honorific is "Mr. Doctor Professor". Deference is generally 24/7 unless permission is given otherwise.  Americans are generally more relaxed about honorifics.

Professors who lead research labs or groups  (they are also referred to as principal investigators or PIs) exercise considerable control and power over the lives and future of students in their groups. There are also different leadership styles. Some are gentlemanly and empathic and some are downright sadists who rely on humiliation and punishments. I suspect they would resort to corporal punishment if they were allowed -- sound familiar? I've always thought it would be interesting to compare research groups to M/s households.

In academia we don't train our students to be more deferential or to focus on the psychological needs of the PI. Nor do we (normally) use humiliation or corporal punishment to train students. I canâ€™t say I ever used a crop on a student ... although I thought some deserved it! And certainly physical interaction is grounds for dismissal.  Our  goal is to train our students to become better versions of ourselves. We are most proud of the students who go forth and surpass us in their achievements. This reflects well on us.  

In my brief time interacting with the BDSM community, I have come to ask, can't serious mentoring be part of a Dom's/Master's interaction with their sub/slave?  I have heard lip-service paid to this idea, but from what I've seen, most Doms or Masters don't actually have much to offer their subs/slaves beyond sexual and psychological fulfillment. For some, perhaps for most, this may be enough. After all most D-types are average humans and most s-types are average humans. But for some of us, this is not enough and we seek to pay more than lip-service to the notion that we are true mentors to our subs or slaves.  All this brings me to what I believe is my role as a Dominant.

## What I believe

I believe that when I take a sub/slave under my wing, it is my responsibility to provide not just emotional and sexual rewards, but also mentorship, structure and a real education grounded in my unique professional experiences in science, technology, business, sports and art. I see my role as a Dominant and would-be Master as a natural extension of my role as a University Professor. I want to create a mix of pleasure and emotional/psychological games that enrich the educational experience in a manner that is not socially acceptable in more conventional educational settings. It is of course a bit of an experiment. But for me life is, at it's best, one big experiment!  

Some of the educational material is super basic and dead simple. For example, my subs should know European dining etiquette, how to properly hold chopsticks, how to properly sit in Seiza, how to deal with conflict, anxiety and difficult personalities, how to deal with the psychology and nuances of verbal communication.

I have a deep internal need to make a difference in the lives of the young women in my circle.  Sometimes this has required out-of-the-box thinking. In at least one case, I guided a young woman to professional psychotherapy, which I sponsored. It made a huge difference in her life and I found it immensely satisfying to have been the instrument of change.

I believe that part of the reason that a potential sub wants to be with me is to create positive change in her life.  Anyone can train a sub/slave the idiosyncratic skills required to please their Dom or Master sexually. But when the time comes for the partners to move on, for the young woman to find a life partner, the real question becomes have you made a positive change in the young woman's life?
