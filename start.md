## The Psychology of BDSM

Nothing wrong with you if you like BDSM. Research shows that BDSM practitioners are a surprisingly healthy crowd. Here is selection of readings from [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com). You can follow citations in the articles to the primary papers, but these articles provide a decent overview of the results.

* [The Surprising Psychology of BDSM](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm)

* [What Kind of People Enjoy BDSM](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-about-sex/201908/what-kind-people-enjoy-bdsm)

* [BDSM, Personality and Mental Health](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201307/bdsm-personality-and-mental-health)

* [Personality Traits of BDSM Practitioners: Another Look](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201502/personality-traits-bdsm-practitioners-another-look)

Read the articles and then consider the question of who's a pervert and who's not. Jay Wiseman [Wiseman1996] provided an operational definition of sorts: "a pervert is anybody kinkier than you".
